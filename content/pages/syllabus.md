Course Description
------------------

This course is an introduction to epistemology: the theory of knowledge. We will focus on skepticism—that is, the thesis that we know nothing at all. Skepticism is hard to believe. It is common sense that we know a great deal about the external world through science and through ordinary observation. As G.E. Moore once argued, I know that I have hands because I can _see_ them. However, there are some powerful arguments for skepticism that threaten to undermine this common sense assumption. What if I am dreaming, or being deceived by an evil demon, or being stimulated by a neuroscientist in a laboratory, or imprisoned in the Matrix? These skeptical scenarios may seem far–fetched, but how can I know they are not actually true? And if I can't know this, then how can I know anything at all, even something as seemingly obvious as the fact that I have two hands?
